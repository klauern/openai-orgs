# Progress: [OpenAI Orgs]

## What Works

- Core API client and CLI structure follow project guidelines
- Linting, formatting, and test automation are in place
- Mocking and interface-driven testing are established

## What's Left to Build

- Expand CLI coverage for all API endpoints
- Improve documentation and onboarding guides
- Increase test coverage for edge cases

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Any deviation from documented workflow or coding standards
- Incomplete CLI coverage for new API endpoints
- Areas lacking interface-driven design or testability

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Migrated to strict Go coding and testing standards
- Adopted interface-driven design for testability
- Standardized on core dependencies and project structure
